# LowRankVlasov1D1V

This is an implementation of the algorithm described in "A Low-Rank Projector-Splitting Integrator for the Vlasov--Poisson Equation"[^1]
Note that instead of the Fourier or Semi-Lagrangian discretizations suggested therein, we use a finite volume scheme with a Van Leer flux.

See the notebooks folder for several Jupyter notebooks which contain test cases.
